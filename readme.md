# Practice

 How I am learning about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Java](https://dev.java/)
, and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) (and other things)

# Repositories


Writing and running code is a great way to learn about a language or topic. Below are some projects that I've created to learn about various things.

I typically setup a project as a git repository that is hosted on GitHub. I like to use [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/all/) IDEs.


## Rust
[lib-wc](https://github.com/wcygan/lib-wc) 

I put random crap in here [when I am trying to learn Rust](https://www.wcygan.io/post/learning-rust-in-2023/).

> [view the lib-wc crate on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/lib-wc)

## Go

[go-practice](https://github.com/wcygan/go-practice)

## Java

[java-practice](https://github.com/wcygan/java-practice)

Before I got into Rust, I liked Java for a little bit. This repository contains some remnants of that.

## Scala

[scala-practice](https://github.com/wcygan/scala-practice)

# References

Here are books that I've found useful. I've read through most of them & highlight the ones which have been most impactful to me.

I recommend [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) if you are struggling to find a way to learn a certain topic in Computer Science.

[O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) and [Manning](https://www.manning.com/) are great resources to find books and projects!

# Community

Learning from others is a good strategy! Here are resources from people in various communities that I look at every now and then

### Rust

# Miscellaneous

## Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) acts as a powerful note taking app. It markets itself as:

>a powerful and extensible knowledge base
that works on top of your local folder of plain text files

I'd have to agree with that; it's pretty freaking good...

I use it as my own personal wiki & write notes on topics that I'm interested in.

You can see how other people set their vaults up by looking at ["Digital Gardens"](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).

### Obsidian + Git

Since Obsidian uses plain text files in a folder, you can naturally model your vault as a git repository. This allows you to treat your notes similar to code.
